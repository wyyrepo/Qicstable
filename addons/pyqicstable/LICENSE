ICS COMMERCIAL LICENSE AGREEMENT
FOR QT BASED PRODUCTS

Agreement version ICS-2.6

IMPORTANT-READ CAREFULLY:
1. This Integrated Computer Solutions Incorporated End-User 
License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal agreement between 
you (either an individual or a legal entity) ("Licensee") 
and Integrated Computer Solutions Incorporated ("ICS") for 
the ICS software product(s) accompanying this Agreement, 
which include(s) computer software and may include "online" 
or electronic documentation, associated media, and printed 
materials, including the source code, example programs and 
the documentation ("Licensed Software").

2. The Licensed Software is protected by copyright laws and 
international copyright treaties, as well as other 
intellectual property laws and treaties. The Licensed 
Software is licensed, not sold.

3. The terms of the License Certificate ("License 
Certificate") accompanying the Licensed Software are 
considered part of the Agreement. In the event of 
inconsistency or conflict between the language of this 
Agreement and the License Certificate, the provisions of 
this Agreement shall govern.

4. By installing, copying, or otherwise using the Licensed 
Software, Licensee agrees to be bound by the terms of this 
Agreement. If Licensee does not agree to the terms of this 
Agreement, Licensee may not install, copy, or otherwise use 
the Licensed Software; Licensee may, however, return it to 
Licensee's place of purchase for a full refund. In addition, 
by installing, copying, or otherwise using any updates or 
other components of the Licensed Software that Licensee 
receives separately as part of the Licensed Software 
("Updates"), Licensee agrees to be bound by any additional 
license terms that accompany such Updates. If Licensee does 
not agree to the additional license terms that accompany 
such Updates, Licensee may not install, copy, or otherwise 
use such Updates.

5. Upon Licensee's acceptance of the terms and conditions of 
this Agreement, ICS grants Licensee the right to use the 
Licensed Software in the manner provided below.

6. ICS grants to Licensee as an individual a personal, 
nonexclusive, nontransferable license to make and use copies 
of the Licensed Software for the sole purposes of designing, 
developing, and testing Licensee's software product(s) 
("Applications"). Licensee may install copies of the 
Licensed Software on an unlimited number of computers 
provided that Licensee is the only individual using the 
Licensed Software. If Licensee is an entity, ICS grants 
Licensee the right to designate one, and only one, 
individual within Licensee's organization who shall have the 
sole right to use the Licensed Software in the manner 
provided above. Licensee may at any time, but not more 
frequently that once every six (6) months, designate another 
individual to replace the current designated user by 
notifying ICS, so long as there is no more than one 
designated user at any given time.

7. The Licensed Software may provide links to third party 
libraries or code (collectively "Third Party Libraries") to 
implement various functions. Third Party Libraries are not 
prepared by or owned by ICS, and do not comprise part of the 
Licensed Software. In some cases, access to Third Party 
Libraries may be included along with the Licensed Software 
delivery as a convenience for development and testing only. 
Such source code and libraries as are or may be listed in 
the ".../src/3rdparty" source tree delivered with the 
Licensed Software, as may be amended from time to time, do 
not comprise the Licensed Software. Licensee acknowledges 
(1) that some Third Party Libraries may require additional 
licensing of copyright and patents from the owners of such, 
and (2) that distribution of any of the Licensed Software 
referencing any portion of a Third Party Library may require 
appropriate licensing from such third parties. Third Party 
Libraries include but are not limited to the following 
categories: GIF, JPEG and MPEG. 

GENERAL TERMS THAT APPLY TO APPLICATIONS AND 
REDISTRIBUTABLES
8. ICS grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free right to 
reproduce and distribute the object code form of certain 
portions of the Licensed Software ("Redistributables"), as 
specified in Appendix 1, for execution on any operating 
system of a type listed in the License Certificate 
("Platforms"). Copies of Redistributables may only be 
distributed with and for the sole purpose of executing 
Applications permitted under this Agreement that Licensee 
has created using the Licensed Software. Under no 
circumstances may any copies of Redistributables be 
distributed separately.

9. The license granted in this Agreement for Licensee to 
create Applications and distribute them and the 
Redistributables (if any) to Licensee's customers is subject 
to all of the following conditions: (i) all copies of the 
Applications Licensee creates must bear a valid copyright 
notice, either Licensee's own or the copyright notice that 
appears on the Licensed Software; (ii) Licensee may not 
remove or alter any copyright, trademark or other 
proprietary rights notice contained in any portion of the 
Licensed Software; (iii) Redistributables, if any, shall be 
licensed to Licensee's customer "as is"; (ICS MAKES NO 
WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS VIS-A-VIS LICENSEE'S CUSTOMER 
WITH RESPECT TO REDISTRIBUTABLES, AND ICS EXPRESSLY 
DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES VIS-A-VIS LICENSEE'S 
CUSTOMER, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF 
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, 
WHETHER OR NOT ICS KNOWS, HAS REASON TO KNOW, HAS BEEN 
ADVISED OR IS OTHERWISE AWARE OF SUCH PURPOSE); (iv) 
Licensee will indemnify and hold ICS, its related companies 
and its suppliers, harmless from and against any claims or 
liabilities arising out of the use, reproduction or 
distribution of Applications; (v) Applications must be 
developed using a licensed, registered copy of the Licensed 
Software; (vi) Applications must add primary and substantial 
functionality to the Licensed Software; (vii) Applications 
may not pass on functionality which in any way makes it 
possible for others to create software with the Licensed 
Software; (viii) Applications may not compete with the 
Licensed Software; (ix) Licensee may not use ICS's or any of 
its suppliers' names, logos, or trademarks to market the 
Application(s), except to state that the Application was 
developed using the Licensed Software. NOTE: If it exists, 
any Free Edition of the Licensed Software is licensed under 
the terms of the GPL and not under this Agreement. If 
Licensee has, at any time, developed all (or any portions 
of) the Application(s) using the Free Edition, Licensee must 
license such Application(s) (or any portions derived there 
from) under the terms of the Free Software Foundation's GNU 
General Public License (the "GPL") a copy of which is 
located at http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html#SEC1 (i.e., 
any Product(s) and/or parts, components, portions thereof 
developed using GPL licensed software, including Free 
Edition, must be licensed under the terms of the GPL, and 
the GPL-based source code must be made available upon 
request).

WARRANTY DISCLAIMER
10. THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS LICENSED TO LICENSEE "AS IS". 
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ICS ON 
BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS SUPPLIERS, DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES 
AND CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT 
NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT 
WITH REGARD TO THE LICENSED SOFTWARE. THIS WARRANTY 
DISCLAIMER NOTWITHSTANDING, LICENSEE MAY HAVE SPECIFIC LEGAL 
RIGHTS WHICH MAY VARY FROM STATE/JURISDICTION TO 
STATE/JURISDICTION.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
11. IF, ICS'S WARRANTY DISCLAIMER NOTWITHSTANDING, ICS IS 
HELD LIABLE TO LICENSEE, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY 
OTHER LEGAL THEORY, BASED ON THE LICENSED SOFTWARE, ICS'S 
ENTIRE LIABILITY TO LICENSEE AND LICENSEE'S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY 
SHALL BE, AT ICS'S OPTION, EITHER (A) RETURN OF THE PRICE 
LICENSEE PAID FOR THE LICENSED SOFTWARE, OR (B) REPAIR OR 
REPLACEMENT OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE, PROVIDED LICENSEE 
RETURNS TO ICS ALL COPIES OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE AS 
ORIGINALLY DELIVERED TO LICENSEE. ICS SHALL NOT UNDER ANY 
CIRCUMSTANCES BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE BASED ON FAILURE OF THE 
LICENSED SOFTWARE IF THE FAILURE RESULTED FROM ACCIDENT, 
ABUSE OR MISAPPLICATION, NOR SHALL ICS UNDER ANY 
CIRCUMSTANCES BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL DAMAGES, PUNITIVE OR 
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS OR 
INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS OR FOR LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA. 
ANY AWARD OF DAMAGES FROM ICS TO LICENSEE SHALL NOT EXCEED 
THE TOTAL AMOUNT LICENSEE HAS PAID TO ICS IN CONNECTION WITH 
THIS AGREEMENT. 

SUPPORT AND UPDATES
12. Licensee will be eligible to receive email and telephone 
based software developer support and access to Updates to 
the Licensed Software for a period not to exceed one year 
from the date of initial delivery, in accordance with ICS's 
then current license agreement, policies and procedures, if 
any. Such policies and procedures may be changed from time 
to time.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
TERMINATION
13. ICS may terminate the Agreement at any time immediately 
upon written notice by ICS to Licensee if Licensee breaches 
this Agreement, fails to pay the fees for the Licensed 
Software, or infringes ICS's intellectual property in or to 
the Licensed Software. Upon termination of the Licenses, 
Licensee shall return to ICS all copies of Licensed Software 
that were supplied by ICS. All other copies of Licensed 
Software in the possession or control of Licensee must be 
erased or destroyed. An officer of Licensee must promptly 
deliver to ICS a written confirmation that this has 
occurred.

GOVERNMENT END USERS
14. A "U.S. Government End User" shall mean any agency or 
entity of the government of the United States. The following 
shall apply if Licensee is a U.S. Government End User. The 
Licensed Software is a "commercial item," as that term is 
defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of 
"commercial computer software" and "commercial computer 
software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 
12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 
C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. 
Government End Users acquire the Licensed Software with only 
those rights set forth herein. The Licensed Software 
(including related documentation) is provided to U.S. 
Government End Users: (a) only as a commercial end item; and 
(b) only pursuant to this Agreement.

COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL LAWS
15. Licensee shall comply with all applicable laws and 
regulations relating to the Licensed Software in the United 
States and in other countries in which Licensee uses or 
modifies the Licensed Software. Without limiting the 
generality of the foregoing, Licensee shall not export, 
reexport, disclose or distribute any of the Licensed 
Software in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, 
including the export laws and regulations of the United 
States, and shall comply with all such laws and regulations.

16. This Agreement may only be modified in writing signed by 
authorized representatives of Licensee and ICS. In case of a 
conflict between the Agreement and the terms of any purchase 
order or other ordering document, the Agreement shall 
prevail. If any provision of the Agreement is found void or 
unenforceable, the remainder will remain valid and 
enforceable according to its terms. If any remedy provided 
is determined to have failed for its essential purpose, all 
limitations of liability and exclusions of damages set forth 
in this Agreement shall remain in effect.

17. This Agreement shall be construed, interpreted and 
governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
USA. Any action or proceeding arising from or relating to 
this Agreement shall be brought in the Federal Courts 
sitting in Boston, Massachusetts or in the State Court in 
Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and each party irrevocably 
submits to the personal jurisdiction of any such court in 
any such action or proceeding. The Agreement gives Licensee 
specific legal rights; Licensee may have others, which vary 
from state to state and from country to country. ICS 
reserves all rights not specifically granted in this 
Agreement.

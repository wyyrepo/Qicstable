- Selection problems with combo-boxes, problems with dragging
  combo/check boxes when the selection policy is SelectSingleRow, and
  problem when moving data using the middle mouse button on checkboxes.
- Spans behavior when a row or column was inserted or deleted.
- Focus policy to allow the user to cycle between widgets using
  tab key.
- Error with deleting a single row 0.
- Error where the wrong row was deleted when the data model of
  this row is empty.
- Sorting of Billable Rate in Consultant example. Allows the
  table to decide what is the data type of first entered data.
- Error in the traverseToCell() function.
- Printing error with cells overflow behavior on non-first
  pages.
- Selection error where the selection of multiple check- or combobox
  cells wasn't possible.

Added:
- User can use the tab key to apply currently editing text,
without the necessity of switching to another cell. (bug#52, case #21407)
- Extended a behavior of QicsComboCellDisplay with QComboBox method
  calls.

QicsTable 1.1.0 (beta 2)
--------------------------------------

Fixed:
- Behavior of check box and combobox cell displayers.
- Selection error where the selection of multiple check- or combobox
  cells wasn't possible.
- Error where wrong coordinates of cells are returned when frozen
  rows/columns were used.
- Error where the program failed when more than one row/column
  was deleted.
- Bug where the cell entry widgets didn't hide when frozen
  rows/columns were used.
- Bug where spans and hidden rows/columns didn't follow the data
  model.
- Selection of column when some cells of that column are already
  selected.
- Deselection of cells in selected column/row.
- Segmentation fault when the user selects a column.
- Style manager segmentation fault on clearing properties.
- Row/column selection problem.
- Ctrl-left mouse row selection problem.
- addSelection() function to use model coordinates.
- Parameters for function calls in the functions
  QicsColumn::minWidthInPixels() and
  QicsMappedDimensionManager::columnMinWidth(). Added header size
  calculation for an expansion toggle.
- Position index for insertion calculating.
- Qt Designer plugin. Fixed isContainer property of the plugin.

Added:
- Constructor to use QicsTable with Qt Designer.

QicsTable 1.1.0 (beta 1)
--------------------------------------

Fixed:
- Layout error where an extra blank space was shown at the bottom and
  right edges of the table.
- Bug where a selection made outside the main grid (in the header
  grids, for example) did not correctly cause the current cell in the
  main grid to be invalidated.
- Bug where double clicking a cell was not causing the cell to
  enter edit mode.
- Bug where clicking and dragging when the selection policy is
  SelectSingle or SelectSingleRow would cause the current cell to
  incorrectly move.
- Many memory leaks.

Added:
- traversalKeyEditBehavior grid property. This allows the
  programmer to control the behavior of the traversal keys when
  editing a cell.
- editForegroundColor and editBackgroundColor properties. These
  colors will be used by QicsTextCellDisplay objects when a cell is
  being edited.
- Visual row, column, and cell properties. This allows the
  programmer to set properties that stay on a particular visual row,
  column, or cell, regardless of the ordering of the model. See the
  HOWTO page "Model vs. Visual Indices in QicsTable" for more
  details.
- Repeating visual row and column flyweight objects. Row and
  column properties can now be set on repeating series of rows or
  columns. See QicsRepeatingRow and QicsRepeatingColumn for details.
- toolTipText cell property. See QicsCellCommon::toolTipText for
  details.
- Row and column stretching. See QicsRow::stretchable() and
  QicsColumn::stretchable() for details.
- Row and column hiding. See QicsRow::hide(), QicsRow::show(),
  QicsColumn::hide(), and QicsColumn::show() for details.
- QicsTable::setDefaultRowHeightInPixels(),
  QicsTable::setDefaultRowHeightInChars(),
  QicsTable::setDefaultColumnWidthInPixels(), and
  QicsTable::setDefaultColumnWidthInChars().
- Increased performance in some areas.

QicsTable 1.0.1
--------------------------------------

Fixed:
- Traversal bug where some traversal actions would cause the
  previously traversed cell to stay selected.
- Traversal bug where traversing via keyboard, followed by
  traversing to a new cell via mouse, followed by traversing via
  keyboard would result in the current cell moving to an incorrect
  cell.
- Bug where freezing rows would result in the visibleColumns
  property setting being ignored.
- Bug where freezing rows and then calling
  QicsTable::setLeftHeaderVisible(false) would not remove one of the
  row header grids.
- Bug where clicking a column header in a table with a
  selectionPolicy of SINGLE_ROW or MULTIPLE_ROW caused incorrect cells
  to be selected.

QicsTable 1.0.0
--------------------------------------

Fixed:
- Drawing bug when cells in the first column of the table contain
  pixmaps.

QicsTable 0.9.7 (beta)
--------------------------------------

Fixed:
- Selection bug where "unselecting" cells (by ctrl-clicking them)
  caused an incorrect selection list.
- Build error using MSVC 7.0 compiler.

Added:
- QicsSelection now has the concept of "selected" vs. "unselected".
  This allows a QicsSelection object to also represent an
  "unselection".
- QicsTable::selectionActionList(), which represents the user's
  actual actions when selecting or unselecting cells in the table.

QicsTable 0.9.6 (beta)
--------------------------------------

- Bug where edit widget was not hidden from the current cell if the
  current cell was in a row that was just deleted.
- Bug where traversing out of a cell after editing it caused a
  change to the data model, even if the data was not changed by the
  user.
- Bug where two single clicks caused a cell to go into edit mode,
  rather than the correct double click.
- In QicsCheckCellDisplay, the valueChanged() method was not being called
  when the user changed the value of the check box.
- Changed QicsCheckCellDisplay to draw using the palette's base color
  as the background for the check box.
- Bug where QicsCheckCellDisplay did not use the correct
  background color when drawing a cell that was selected.
- Bug where coordinates of mouse clicks in signals were relative
  to the internal grid widgets they originated from, rather than from
  the table widget.

Added:
- Property to QicsComboCellDisplay ("addValueToList") that
  specifies whether data values from the model that are not in the
  combobox's list should be added to the list.
- valueChanged() signals to QicsTable and QicsGridCommon. Cell
  coordinates passed in these signals are in visual coordinates.
- New demo, "consultant", which demonstrates the use of many
  different cell display objects, custom validators, custom
  formatters, as well as many other QicsTable features.

QicsTable 0.9.5 (beta)
--------------------------------------

Fixed:
- Layout bug with frozen rows/columns.
- Crash when destroying table under certain circumstances.

Added:
- Extremely significant increase in drawing, scrolling, and update
  speed.
- Changed visual display to look more like Excel and QTable (main grid
  background is now the colorgroup's base() color, some border and
  spacing values were changed).
- Documentation additions (customizing grids) and corrections.
